## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **GPO link order priority** — SMB signing and LDAP configuration checks now
  show which GPO is effectively applied (`IsEffectiveSetting`) based on GPO
  link order precedence (DC OU beats Domain-level)
- **HTML diff report** in `Compare-adPEASReport` for visual scan comparison
- **PublishedOn** property on certificate templates

### Changed

- **scriptPath** display for user accounts now shows with conditional severity

### Fixed

- GPO local group membership check not reporting findings
- Add-Computer severity now correctly distinguishes restricted scope
  (Administrators only → secure) from broad scope (Authenticated Users,
  Everyone → finding)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-02

Initial release of adPEAS v2 — a complete rewrite of adPEAS v1.

### Added

- **Unified LdapConnection architecture** replacing legacy DirectoryEntry/DirectorySearcher
- **Native Kerberos stack** — AS-REQ/AS-REP, TGS-REQ/TGS-REP, Pass-the-Ticket, all in pure PowerShell
- **Authentication methods** — Password, NT-Hash (OPtH), AES keys (PtK), PKINIT, Pass-the-Cert/Schannel, Windows integrated auth
- **Kerberos-first authentication** with automatic fallback to NTLM Impersonation and SimpleBind
- **UnPAC-the-Hash** — automatic NT-Hash recovery after PKINIT authentication
- **41+ security checks** across 9 categories (Domain, Creds, Rights, Delegation, ADCS, Accounts, GPO, Computer, Application)
- **ADCS vulnerability detection** — ESC1 through ESC15
- **Severity scoring system** with Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info levels and risk scores
- **Interactive HTML reports** with search, filtering, sorting, dark/light theme, and tooltips
- **JSON export** for machine-readable output, offline report conversion, and scan comparison
- **Report comparison** (`Compare-adPEASReport`) — diff two scans to track remediation progress
- **Offline report conversion** (`Convert-adPEASReport`) — regenerate reports from JSON without LDAP connection
- **Incremental scanning** with `-OutputAppend` to merge findings across multiple runs
- **BloodHound CE collector** — built-in data collection for attack path analysis
- **Offensive operations** — Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, Golden/Silver/Diamond Tickets, RBCD abuse, Shadow Credentials, GPO abuse
- **Session-based workflow** — connect once, run multiple checks interactively
- **Tab-completion** for AD object names (`-BuildCompletionCache`)
- **OPSEC mode** — skip active testing (Kerberoast, ASREPRoast, BloodHound)
- **Verbose logging** to file for troubleshooting (`-VerboseLogging`)
- **LDAP timeout configuration** (`-TimeoutSeconds`) for slow connections (SOCKS, VPN)
- **RSA-SHA256 license system** with build-time embedding and runtime override
- **Four release variants** — readable, minimized, ultra-compressed, and obfuscated

### Changed

- Zero external dependencies — no RSAT, no ActiveDirectory module, no PowerView
- All LDAP operations use `System.DirectoryServices.Protocols.LdapConnection`
- Modular source structure (`src/modules/`) compiled into single standalone `.ps1` file
- SID-based identity checks for language-independent operation

### Removed

- PowerView dependency
- DirectoryEntry/DirectorySearcher usage
